GAMEDESC
While having a cup of tea atop an old house, you accidentally fall through the roof into a small broom closet.  There is no way back to the roof, but a door leads out of the closet.  After allocating a combined total of 100 points of attack, defense, and regeneration, you prepare to open the door and discover what lays beyond.
